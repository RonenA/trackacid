== TrackAcid

An RSS Reader for music blogs built on Rails and Backbone. This project was built by [@RonenA](https://twitter.com/RonenA) after graduating from [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/), with the help of [Sam Eisenstat](https://github.com/SamEisenstat).

You can check it out semi-live at [trackacid.com](http://www.trackacid.com). It all works but new songs are no longer fetched (Heroku don't grow on trees).
